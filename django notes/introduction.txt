Introduction to Web development and Django
========================================
Web Application:
-------------------------
The application which can be provided services over the web are called as web applications.
Ex:
		gmail,facebook.....

Every web app have 2-components:
	1.Front End
	2.Back End

1.Front End:
	-->It represents what end user is seeing on the website.
	-->We can develop front end component by using HTML,CSS,JS,Jquery & Bootstrap.

HTML:
	Hyper Text Markup Language
	Every web application should contain HTML. i.e HTML is mandatory technology 
	for web development. It represents structure of web page.

CSS:Cascade Style Sheets
	-->It is an optional technology, still web application contains CSS.
	-->The main objective of CSS is to add styles to the HTML pages like colors,
	 fonts,borders etc.....

Java Script:
	-->It allows to add interactivity to the web application including programming 
	logic.
	-->The main objective of java script is to add functionality to the HTML pages. i.e to add dynamic nature to the HTML pages.
	
		HTML-->Meant for static response
		HTML + JS -->Meant for dynamic response.

Ex-1:
	To display 'Welcome To Django Classes' response to the end user only HTML is
	 enough, bxoz it is static response.

Ex-2:
	To display current server data and time to the end user, only HTML is not 
	enough we required to use some extra technology like JS,JSP,ASP,PHP etc 
	as it is dynamic response.

Static Response vs Dynamic Response:
-----------------------------------------------------------
-->If the response is not varied from time to time and person to person then
 it is considered as static response.
Ex:
	login page of gmail
	login page of facebook

-->If the response is varied from time to time and person to person then
 it is considered as dynamic response.
Ex:
	Inbox page of gmail
	Inbox page of HDFC Bank

2).Backend:
------------------
-->It is the technology used to decide what to show to the end user on the 
front-end.
-->i.e back end is responsible to generate required response to the end user,
 which is displayed by the Front-End.
-->Back-End have 3-components.
		1.The language:Python,Java etc.....
		2.The framework:Django,Flask,Pyramid........
		3.The database like Oracle,Mysql,MongoDB.....

-->For backend language python is the best choice bcoz:Simple and easy,concie code
-->For framework Django is best.
-->Django provides inbuilt DB sqlite-3.
